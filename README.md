# Pokédex

## Introduction

Gotta Catch ’Em All!

This is a Pokémon catalogue built with Javascript, HTML and CSS. The application  uses the Pokémon API (PokéAPI).


## How to run

You can clone the repo, open the folder in VS code and use VS Code's Live Server Feature. There's also a Netlify link if you want to check it out:

## Dataset and Description

PokéAPI is the RESTful Pokémon API that serves over 250,000,000 API calls each month. This is the official go to site for all the Pokémon data you will ever need. This is a consumption-only API — only the HTTP GET method is available on resources.No authentication is required to access this API, and all resources are fully open and available. Since the move to static hosting in November 2018, rate limiting has been removed entirely, but you are  still encouraged you to limit the frequency of requests to limit our hosting costs. You can find it here. https://pokeapi.co/

As always, working with API requires reading up on a lot of documentation. You can check out the docs here: https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2


Here's the info for Pikachu https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/pikachu


## Limitations

I was only able to capture 897 Pokémon on the website. After the 897th index, the API calls got routed to different indexes of different values. Also, types of some Pokémon could not be captured due to some having mutiple types. 

## Future Work

- Add Material UI to spruce up UI.
- Add search and filter buttons.
- Allow users to click on a Pokémon and get it's infocard
